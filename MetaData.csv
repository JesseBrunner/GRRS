studyVolume,Volume of publication
studyPages,Page range of publication
eventDate,"Date of sample collection, as close as can be determined. When dates are not provided we have used January 1st of the year of publication and when only a month or season (or range of years!) is provided we have done or best to find a reasonable midpoint."
eventYear,"Year in which sample(s) were collected, from eventDate"
eventLocation.country,Country of sample collection
eventLocation.degreesLat,"Location data were entered as available in the reference (either degrees, minutes, seconds, or decimal degree). When location was vague we used the location of the nearest named town or midpoint of a province or country (from Google Maps). When animals had been imported, we used the source location if provided and sampling was within a month or two from importation, or the recipient location otherwise."
